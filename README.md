# Igrot project


Hello in this project I made an app that can nevitage throw the letters of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.
You can save the letters you like and you can choose random letter , each one of those options as a tab (as you can see on screen shots) .
in the project I build a database that holds all the letters that I download from the web with HTTPTracker(website copier). 
I arrange them into mySQL database that hosts on Hostinger.com .
Also theres an hebrew date that i receive from API as JSON from site that provide it : www.hebcal.com.

Heres the link to the app : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.az.igrot.hakodesh&gl=IL

Several screen shots of the app :
